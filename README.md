[Experiential Labs](https://experientiallabs.ai) provider extension for the [pi coding agent](https://pi.dev), featuring **dynamic model discovery** — models are fetched from the Experiential Labs API whenever pi refreshes the model list.

## Features

- 🔍 **Dynamic model discovery** — models are fetched live from the Experiential Labs API
- 🔄 **Auto-refresh** — model list updates when you open `/model` in pi
- 🛠️ **Zero configuration** — just set your API key and go
- 🔌 **Multiple API formats** — supports Chat Completions, Responses, and Anthropic Messages APIs

## Set up

First, you'll obviously need pi installed in your system. Instructions at [pi.dev](https://pi.dev).

Then, installing the extension is trivial:

```
pi install npm:@joeljuca/pi-explabs
```

You'll need an API key to authenticate. Get one at [experientiallabs.ai](https://experientiallabs.ai).

Set an environment variable `EXPLABS_API_KEY` with your API key, somehow. I use and recommend [direnv](https://direnv.net), but any method will do.

```sh
EXPLABS_API_KEY='<Your API key here>'
```

You're ready. Run pi normally, the extension should be automatically:

```
pi
```

## Use

Usage is mostly automatic. The extension will make your pi integrate seamlessly with Experiential Labs, so you should be able to see their models when you `/model`, the list will be reloaded when you `/reload`, etc.

Here's what the extenstion will do:

1. It registers `explabs` as a model provider in pi
1. Fetches a fresh list of available models from Experiential Labs when you open pi
1. Refresh the list of models when you `/model` or `/reload`
1. **API fetch**: The callback fetches models from the Experiential Labs `/v1/models` endpoint

> 💡 Troubleshoot
>
> If something is not working properly, you're not seeing Experiential Labs' models when you `/model`, etc., the first place to check is your API key:
>
> ```sh
> echo $EXPLABS_API_KEY
> ```
>
> Test it against the API:
>
> ```bash
> curl https://api.experientiallabs.ai/v1/models -H "Authorization: Bearer $EXPLABS_API_KEY"
> ```
>
> Reload pi (while in pi, run `/reload`). Check pi's console output for error messages, you'll most certainly find insights on what's wrong.
>
> If nothing works and you believe it's a bug in the extension itself, open an issue at [https://github.com/joeljuca/pi-explabs/issues](https://github.com/joeljuca/pi-explabs/issues).
